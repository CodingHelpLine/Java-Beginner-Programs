In learning to draw, charcoal is the most available material that can
be used, as, with it, large and striking effects are so easily and
quickly produced, while it is also adapted to the most careful work,
and may be carried on to any degree of finish. Another quality which
renders charcoal especially of value as a medium for beginners in
drawing is that it is so easily erased.

Charcoal is used for drawing from the cast and from the human figure
in all the large art schools of Europe as well as in our own country,
and is especially adapted to sketching from nature, as by its use most
charming landscape and marine effects may be obtained.
